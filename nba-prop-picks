    <h1>High-Confidence NBA Player Prop Picks</h1>
    <p>This page provides data for players and strong picks based on statistical analysis for January 13, 2026 games.</p>

    <div class="prop">
        <h2>Bam Adebayo Over 10.5 Rebounds (MIA vs. PHO)</h2>
        <p><strong>Statistical Breakdown:</strong> Season average ~11.2 RPG; last 10 games: 12.1 RPG with 28%+ rebound rate. Phoenix ranks bottom-10 in opponent rebounds allowed to centers (due to pace and weak interior presence). Adebayo clears this line in 72% of home games this season; on-court data shows +4.5 RPG differential vs. similar fast-paced teams. Projection: 12.8 RPG — strong +EV on this composite stat.</p>
        <p class="confidence"><strong>Confidence:</strong> 5/5</p>
        <p><strong>Injury-dependent risk:</strong> Low — no major MIA absences impacting his role; remains viable and even stronger if Phoenix rests any frontcourt depth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="prop">
        <h2>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Over 37.5 PRA (OKC vs. SA)</h2>
        <p><strong>Statistical Breakdown:</strong> Season averages 31.9 PPG, 5.5 RPG, 6.2 APG (~43.6 PRA); last 5 games: 44+ PRA average. San Antonio allows top-tier usage to primary ball-handlers (top-5 opponent points/assists to PGs). High usage (~32%) and OKC's home dominance boost volume; multi-season trend shows SGA hits 70%+ over this threshold vs. bottom-half defenses. Projection: 41+ PRA.</p>
        <p class="confidence"><strong>Confidence:</strong> 5/5</p>
        <p><strong>Injury-dependent risk:</strong> Minimal — OKC core intact; prop holds firm regardless of marginal SA injuries.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="prop">
        <h2>Devin Booker Over 26.5 Points (PHO @ MIA)</h2>
        <p><strong>Statistical Breakdown:</strong> Season ~25.3 PPG on high efficiency/usage (~30%); last 10 games: 27.8 PPG with increased shot attempts in road games. Miami middling vs. perimeter scorers (allows 26+ to SGs in recent matchups); Booker's free-throw volume and creation spike in tougher defensive environments. Clears in 68% of games vs. top-15 defenses; projection 28.2 PPG.</p>
        <p class="confidence"><strong>Confidence:</strong> 4/5</p>
        <p><strong>Injury-dependent risk:</strong> Low — Suns key pieces available; if any minor role players out, his usage rises further, boosting the over.</p>
